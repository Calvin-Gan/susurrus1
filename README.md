SUSURRUS is a game about exporing dimensions. Run-down, decaying dimensions. 
Some are cozy and quaint, glowing fireflies circling endlessly in a forest, while some have danger lurking within. 
The unnamed "Wanderer" traverses these lost landscapes. Come along, and see the sights. 
In the darkness, a quiet whisper.
